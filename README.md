# FloatingButton
The Project is intended to provide the floating button feature, introduced in Android Lollipop, to lower version devices
All you need to do, is to call a "setImage" Method to set image resource on the floating button

				//Menubutton refers to floating button
                menuButton.setImage(R.drawable.menu);


Here you can see the effect
